  "description": "PitLane Proof is a specialized fact-checking framework designed for time-constrained editors and writers in the electric vehicle industry. It addresses the critical challenge of rapidly verifying high-risk claims using only publicly available web sources, focusing on three specific claim categories where misinformation carries significant reputational and legal risk: (1) Executive Information including corporate titles, professional credentials, educational backgrounds, and career histories which must be verified with precision to avoid defamation risks and maintain journalistic credibility; (2) Product Superlatives such as best-selling rankings, performance records including fastest, most efficient, longest range claims, and market position statements that require multi-source validation to avoid misleading consumer information and potential regulatory issues; (3) Event Schedules covering conference dates and venues, racing event schedules, product launch events, and industry gatherings where incorrect information can damage media relationships and reader trust. The framework employs a systematic verification methodology that starts with intelligent claim parsing to extract entities, relationships, and temporal context from natural language claims, then performs entity disambiguation through web search to resolve ambiguities between similarly named executives, companies, or products. It conducts ethical web scraping with strict robots.txt compliance and rate limiting to collect evidence from authoritative sources including official corporate websites, verified press releases, investor relations pages, and reputable industry publications. The system automatically generates custom Python parsers tailored to each source's HTML structure for precise data extraction, executes these parsers in sandboxed environments to safely extract structured information, and normalizes field values across different formats including standardizing dates, degree abbreviations, and company name variations. Multi-source validation compares data from independent sources with field-by-field comparison, detects meaningful conflicts versus formatting differences, calculates confidence scores based on source agreement and authority, and applies intelligent conflict resolution strategies preferring higher authority sources or more recent information depending on the claim type. The framework generates publication-ready outputs including human-readable fact cards with comprehensive citations, JSON exports for CMS integration with structured claim metadata, and CSV exports for spreadsheet analysis and batch processing. It performs pre-publication verification by re-checking sources before final publication to detect last-minute changes and provides change alerts when source information has been updated or removed since initial verification. The system enables editorial teams to reduce fact-checking time by 70 percent through automated evidence collection and validation while maintaining high accuracy standards, helps journalists avoid defamation risks by verifying executive information against multiple authoritative sources with complete citation chains, supports compliance teams in validating product marketing claims with traceable evidence packages suitable for regulatory review, and assists content teams in maintaining reader trust through systematic verification of event information and publication schedules. Typical use cases include verifying that a specific executive holds a claimed position at a company by cross-referencing corporate leadership pages, investor relations documents, and press releases; validating best-selling vehicle claims by comparing sales rankings across automotive industry reports, manufacturer announcements, and market research publications; confirming conference dates and venues before publication by checking official event websites, venue calendars, and organizer announcements; generating publication-ready fact cards with complete citation chains for editorial review and CMS integration; performing batch verification of multiple claims in draft articles to identify potential issues before publication; and conducting pre-publication source checks to ensure no information has changed since initial verification. The framework handles ambiguous entity references by constructing targeted search queries and ranking results by domain authority, manages conflicting information across sources through transparent resolution strategies with human-readable explanations, processes JavaScript-heavy websites by focusing on server-rendered content and official press materials, and maintains complete audit trails linking every verified fact to specific source URLs with access timestamps and relevant content snippets for independent verification and potential legal defense.",
